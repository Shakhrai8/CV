Hi, I'm Yevhen, a motivated and skilled student from one of the most renowned dev bootcamps in the world. After five years in the construction industry, I was inspired by the creativity, problem-solving, and constant evolution inherent in the world of tech, prompting my shift to software development. My background in coordination and problem-solving from my time in the construction industry in Germany equips me with a unique perspective and transferable skills that I'm excited to leverage in the tech industry.

## Work Experience

**HBS Elektroanlagenbau GmbH (2016 to 2021)**

- Utilized problem-solving skills and coordinated projects for the installation of 63 control cabinets with Ikea in Karlsruhe, enhancing my ability to manage complex tasks and improving efficiency.
- Collaborated with teams on projects for companies like Ikea, Dachser, MEWA, BMW, demonstrating my teamwork, communication skills, and ability to execute tasks to perfection.
- Developed strong attention to detail and safety protocols while working as an Electrician in Control cabinet construction and installation.

## Skills In-Depth

**Agile Development**

During my work on projects like [Trail](https://github.com/Shakhrai8/trail) and [Acebook](https://github.com/Shakhrai8/acebook), our teams adopted the Agile methodology for development. Each morning, we'd kick off with standup meetings to discuss the previous day's achievements and the day's goals. Tools like Trello helped us manage our sprints, and iterative feedback loops ensured we stayed aligned with user needs.

**TDD (Test-Driven Development)**

My commitment to creating robust and bug-free applications has been demonstrated in every project I've worked on, particularly with [Trail](https://github.com/Shakhrai8/trail) and [Acebook](https://github.com/Shakhrai8/acebook). Utilizing frameworks like Jest and Cypress, TDD became an integral part of the development process. This approach not only caught issues early but also helped in designing clearer, more maintainable code structures.

**Pair Programming & Communication**

Collaboration and communication have been key to accelerating my learning and producing high-quality code. Through projects like [Cyber Twitter](https://github.com/Shakhrai8/cyber-twitter) and [MakersBnB](https://github.com/Shakhrai8/makers_bnb), I had the chance to work closely with other developers using pair programming. This method not only fostered knowledge sharing but also promoted better code quality, as each line of code was reviewed and discussed in real-time.

**Object-Oriented Principles**

In my projects, I've regularly applied OO principles like Encapsulation, Polymorphism, and Inheritance to ensure my code is modular, reusable, and scalable. For instance, in my project [Trail](https://github.com/Shakhrai8/trail), these principles allowed for more maintainable code that could be easily extended with new features.

## Hobbies

I'm an ardent fan of the gym, which keeps me physically active and mentally sharp. Gaming offers an escape and a challenge, often prompting me to strategize and think critically. Swimming serves as a meditative exercise, helping me find calm and clarity.
